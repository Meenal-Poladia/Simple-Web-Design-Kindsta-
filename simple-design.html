				A text editor may sound boring to some, but it’s the lifeblood of so 
				many organizations around the world. From development teams to publishers, 
				text and <a href="#"> code editors </a> are intertwined with almost everyone’s 
				workflows. Many of us bounce in and out of them all day long. Whether you’re 
				writing <a href="#"> PHP </a>, or simply taking notes for a project, there are 
				plenty of great tools to make this task a little easier. Today we’ll outline 
				the absolute best text editor solutions.
			</p>
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				Some of the text editors are excellent for experienced developers, 
				while others are more for beginners or writers. You’ll also find some 
				great editors for collaboration, real-time code sharing, and much more.
			</p>
			<h2> Collection of the Best Text Editors (And Some IDEs)</h2>
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				Here’s a collection of our favorite text editors. Some of these are also 
				considered IDEs, which stands for “integrated development environment.” 
				Meaning you can do a lot more with them than simply write code. We highly 
				recommend testing each one to see which one works best for your own workflow.

			<h2 id="sublime-content"> 1. Sublime Text </h2>
			
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				The <a href="#sublime-title"> Sublime Text </a> editor is definitely one of our favorites! It offers a 
				free version for testing, but all continual users are required to pay $80 
				to keep it active. While $80 might sound steep for a text editor, it’s 
				important to note that the licenses are per-user, rather than per-machine, 
				so you can enjoy Sublime Text on as many computers and operating systems 
				as you wish with your license.
			</p>
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				As for the features, Sublime Text has an advantage in that it’s 
				<span class="boldtext"> extremely lightweight (low resource usage) </span>, 
				but still keeps around some of the more 
				advanced features you would expect out of a top text editor. The primary 
				benefit is that Sublime Text offers shortcuts and search tools for immediately 
				finding certain functions and making changes to multiple lines at once. 
				Jumping to specific symbols or words takes only a few seconds.
			</p>
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				In addition, Sublime Text automatically creates an index of all functions and 
				methods so that you can work with the shortcuts and customize it for locating 
				bits of code while working.

				</a>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="regular-paragraph"> 
				Going along with the trend of shortcuts in Sublime Text, the text editor lets 
				you type in a few keystrokes to move directly to menu items. So, if you wanted 
				to sort something in your document, you wouldn’t be required to sift through the 
				entire menu to find that functionality.
			</p>
			
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				Sublime Text has a Python API, meaning that a wide variety of plugins can be 
				integrated with the text editing solution. This includes the thousands of plugins 
				that are consistently created by the Sublime Text community.
			</p>
			
			<h2> Which Features Make This One of the Best Text Editor Tools? </h2>
			
			<ul class="regular-paragraph">
				<li>
					Sublime Text lets you test out the text editor before committing to the 
					investment. Although it’s a bummer you have to pay for this text editor, 
					you at least get to try it out–and the pricing isn’t that expensive.
				</li>
				<li>
					The text editor runs on multiple platforms such as Mac, Windows, and Linux. 
					It’s also cross-platform, so one license will work on all of your devices–no 
					need to purchase more.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can also customize just about anything in Sublime Text. This is especially 
					true when talking about shortcuts and menus. We recommend tweaking the settings 
					to open files in the same window (new tab).
				</li>
				<li>
					Has some great community themes available. Check out the Dracula Sublime theme.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="regular-paragraph">
				Sublime Text makes the most sense for heavy coders. These developers will enjoy 
				the shortcut functionality and the high level of customization. The cross-platform 
				abilities are also nice for launching the same text editor on all machines.
